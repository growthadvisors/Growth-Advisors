            <h3>Growth = value</h3>
            <p>
            We all know that <strong>sustainable growth creates substantial value.</strong> It demands a higher multiple when valuing your business, which allows others to believe in your forecasts and provide the correct amount of capital for growth and the most desirable valuation on exit.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            Your goal is to build growth momentum…that is, a <strong>reliable acceleration of growth.</strong> This requires you to constantly identify opportunities, make sound decisions based on less-than-complete data, and have the appropriate resources in place to execute your plan.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            <strong>No one person or team can know everything.</strong>  You and your team are smart business professionals who make rational decisions based on the data available to you. But is it always the best decision?  You will never be able to afford all of the resources in-house to ensure that every decision has a good chance of being the best. If you could have “do-overs” for three past decisions, what would make your re-decisions better?  A different perspective? A better knowledge of alternatives? A deeper understanding of customer needs or better prediction of customer behavior? Access to better intel? More experience in the specific area? 
            </p>
            
            <p>
            Once the decision is made, does your team always have the experience and knowledge to give it the best chance for <strong>solid, timely execution?</strong>
            </p>
            
            <p>
            The ability to consistently attain “above-average” results from decisions and execution are the foundation for reliable growth. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
